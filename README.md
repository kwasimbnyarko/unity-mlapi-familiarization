# unity-mlapi-familiarization
I'd be using this repo to familiarise myself with MLAPI for an ongoing project. 
I hope to document this better so it could serve as a crash course, after I've gained some decent knowledge in this area.
Until then, there's a lot of great information here if you're interested https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/docs/getting-started/about-mlapi
Cheers
