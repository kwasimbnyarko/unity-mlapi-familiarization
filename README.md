# unity-mlapi-familiarization
I'd be using this repo to familiarise myself with MLAPI for an ongoing project. Hopefully after I've gained decent knowledge in this area I'd document this better and it could serve as a crash course. Until then, there's a lot of great information here if you're interested https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/docs/getting-started/about-mlapi
